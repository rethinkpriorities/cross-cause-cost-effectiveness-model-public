            The values of alternative weighting schemes are compared with each
            other. DMREU weights each outcome by the power of the probability of
            an outcome at least as good. Here we use functions of the form W(v)
            = P<sup>a</sup>(o | o â‰¥ v). WLU weights each outcome by its value.
            Here we use functions of the form: W(v) = 1/(1 + v<sup>a</sup>).
            Low, moderate, and high levels of risk aversion correspond to values
            of <i>a</i> justifying indifference between a 100% chance of
            averting 10 DALYs and a x% chance of averting 1000 DALYs, for x = 3
            (low), 5 (moderate), and 10 (high). WLU is stake sensitive and the
            stated risk aversion levels do not include the counterfactual costs
            of missed opportunities and should not be taken too seriously.

            These numbers are most appropriately used to compare results within
            a scheme, not across schemes as they are displayed there. The
            relative sizes of numbers in different schemes is of unclear
            significance. Nevertheless, each alternative weighting represents an
            intervention averting X DALYs with certainty to have value X.{" "}

                  Where values are negative, this indicates that under that

                  causing harm with certainty, but there may be additional moral
                  reasons that explain why it is better to take a gamble on a
                  positive result than to cause harm with certainty.
